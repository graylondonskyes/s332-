# SkyeQuantaCore / SkyeHands
## Next-Level Build Directive
### Codespaces-Class Productization Pass

## 0. Product Truth

## Progress Snapshot

This pass added three major implementation lanes at once:

☑ One-command workspace onboarding with repo/template start, machine profile, secret scope, and optional prebuild hydration  
☑ AI patch proposal / review / apply / reject / rollback lane under snapshot control  
☑ Product-facing ops center and AI patch center surfaces under the canonical bridge  


The current product already proves real substance.

**Currently proven in the scanned package:**

☑ Dual-engine architecture exists  
☑ Product-owned shell is the runtime authority  
☑ Remote executor exists  
☑ Multi-workspace execution exists  
☑ Workspace isolation exists  
☑ Recovery and prune behavior exist  
☑ Sessions, governance, audit, snapshots, scheduler, and retention exist  
☑ Gate runtime sealing exists  
☑ Operator-safe handoff exists  
☑ Investor/procurement packet exists  
☑ Ops-plane watch / incident / acknowledge / resolve flow exists  

That means the next level is **not** “invent the product.”  
The next level is **productize the runtime until it feels inevitable**.

---

## 1. North-Star Goal

Build this into a product where a serious operator can:

1. install it cleanly,
2. create a workspace from repo or template,
3. attach a machine profile and secret scope,
4. boot the environment,
5. open code, preview, and agent lanes,
6. use AI safely with diff review and rollback,
7. recover from runtime failures,
8. inspect incidents and watch rules,
9. export support evidence,
10. do all of that without founder babysitting.

That is the target.

---

## 2. What “Next Level” Means

The next level is achieved when the product can truthfully claim all of the following:

☐ Cold machine bootstrap is reliable  
☐ Bridge and probe sequencing are self-healing  
☑ Workspace creation is one-command simple  
☑ Repo/template/prebuild flows are real and clean  
☑ AI coding help is patch-based and reviewable  
☑ Snapshots/rollback are first-class in the UX  
☑ Common file classes are handled cleanly  
☑ Preview routes are stable and visible  
☑ Ops plane is visible and actionable inside product surfaces  
☐ Deploy doctor can go green under canonical startup  
☐ A non-expert operator can run the product from the handoff path successfully  
☐ The investor claim “Codespaces-class sovereign replacement path” is backed by a friction-light operator experience, not just proof JSON

## Batch Implementation Update — Closure Pass

This pass landed real codebase implementations, not paper edits.

### Newly completed in code

☑ Canonical operator start lane (`./skyequanta operator:start --json`)  
☑ Workspace cockpit surfaces (`/workspace-center`, `/runtime-center`, `/gate-center`, `/file-center`)  
☑ Workspace cockpit API (`/api/workspaces/:id/cockpit`)  
☑ Runtime events and runtime logs APIs  
☑ Workspace file ergonomics APIs (tree, inspect, content, search, changed, diff, download)  
☑ Secret scope set / clear actions for workspaces  
☑ Section 24 proof — file ergonomics  
☑ Section 25 proof — workspace cockpit  
☑ Section 26 proof — operator-start readiness  
☑ Deploy doctor green under canonical startup after operator-start bootstrap  

### Still open

☑ File association / fallback UX polish  
☑ AI bounded-context inspection controls  
☑ Version stamp consistency across docs, proof, and ship-candidate bundle  
☑ Packet language and section-proof language alignment  
☑ Final claims gating / closure polish  

### Current closure status

This directive has now cleared the closure pass that was still within repo control.
The core runtime, cockpit, file ergonomics, operator start lane, bounded AI context lane, release stamping, and packet alignment are implemented and proof-backed.
What remains outside this closure slice is the broader cold-machine/operator-comfort finish work rather than missing core runtime lanes.

## Batch Implementation Update — Recovery + Preview Visibility Pass

This pass opened additional product-facing code, not just another paper summary.

### Newly completed in code

☐ Deeper preview/content rendering coverage can still grow beyond the current diagnostics layer  
☐ More live-runtime auto-remediation can still be added beyond start/restart/reassert/evaluate lanes  


## Batch Implementation Update — First-Run Stabilization Pass

☑ Canonical operator stabilization lane (`./skyequanta operator:stabilize`)  
☑ Generated first-run operator checklist artifact (`docs/FIRST_RUN_OPERATOR_CHECKLIST.md`)  
☑ Section 30 proof — first-run stabilization and readiness surfaces  

### Still open

☐ Truly hostile fresh-machine repetition still needs more real-world runs beyond this container pass  
☐ Preview content intelligence can still deepen beyond snapshot/excerpt inspection  
☐ Additional self-healing actions can still be added beyond configure/start/restart/reassert/evaluate

☑ More aggressive self-healing can now run through the persisted autopilot lane  
☐ Truly hostile multi-machine repetition is still needed for final absolute confidence  


## Batch Implementation Update — Autopilot Self-Healing Pass

☑ Section 32 proof — machine readiness and hostile-start rehearsal lane

### Still open

☐ Truly external multi-machine repetition is still needed for final founder-grade certainty
☐ Remediation breadth can still deepen into package-manager-specific auto-fix lanes beyond the current diagnosis/rehearsal layer

☑ Workspace investor-packet APIs (`/api/workspaces/:id/investor-packet`, `/investor-packet/history`, `/investor-packet/run`)
